              <li>Project Designer and Presenter at GIRLS in ICT presented by Ms Geek Rwanda
               March/8
                Design of Wireless black box using MEMS accelerometer and GPS tracking for accidental
                 monitoring of vehicles
              </li>
             <li>I decide to take a class on programming,as you see Ihave done electronic and communication systems
              and Ihave design a project intitled "Wireless black box using accelerometer and GPS tracking for accidental monitoring
              of vehicles this project architecture is made by Microcontroller that will receive information from accellerometer
              and GPS sensors and according to the instructions given to Microcontroller it will act as I want like turn on LED
              make an Alert  putting data in database and so on.The Microcontroller uses programming. This is why I come
              to take this programming class in order to make a good implementation of my project and continue resolving
              some issues in our country
