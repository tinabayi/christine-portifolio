       <p>The website that I have first created is on my-first-website repository.It was about learning software skills<a href="https://github.com/tinabayi/my-first-website.git" target="_blank">My-first-website</a></p>
       <p>The second Project that Ihave done is on cookie-recipe2 Repository .It was about forking  the project of onther person and take his codes online and try to change and make my own <a href="https://github.com/tinabayi/cookie-recipe2.git" target="_blank">cookie-recipe2</a></p>
       <p>The third project that I have worked on is on github with a repository name test<a href="https://github.com/tinabayi/test.git" target="_self">Test</a></p>


       <h2>My background</h2>
         <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
       <p>Bachelor degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering
          University of Rwanda, Huye campus
          Concentration: Electronic and Communication systems</p>
       <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
        <P>Project Designer and Presenter at GIRLS in ICT presented by Ms Geek Rwanda
            March/8
           Design of Wireless black box using MEMS accelerometer and GPS tracking for accidental
            monitoring of vehicles
         </P>
         <P>I decide to take a class on programming,as you see Ihave done electronic and communication systems
            and Ihave design a project intitled "Wireless black box using accelerometer and GPS tracking for accidental monitoring
            of vehicles this project architecture is made by Microcontroller that will receive information from accellerometer
            and GPS sensors and according to the instructions given to Microcontroller it will act as I want like turn on LED
            make an Alert  putting data in database and so on.The Microcontroller uses programming. This is why I come
            to take this programming class in order to make a good implementation of my project and continue resolving
            some issues in our country
         </P>
